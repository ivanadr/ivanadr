### Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋
- Hi, I'm Ivana & my pronouns are she/they :rainbow:
- I have always wanted to have a wholesome & laidback space online that could change as I would. This is it. 

### What is here
- ➡️ My formal website https://github.com/ivanadr/ivanadr.github.io ⬅️
- 🧑‍🔬 Website I co-created as a part of student interest group Women in STEM (WeSTEM) at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) https://github.com/ivanadr/westem-web-2022  
- 📑 How to use a citation manager. Short resource list for my mentee on using Zotero https://github.com/ivanadr/capstone-citation-workflow
- 🏊‍♀️ Virtual leaderboard for asynchronous swim competition during Covid pandemic. The aim was to incentivise students to do sports and combat sedentary behaviour amid online classes https://github.com/ivanadr/swim-leaderboard
- 📊 Stata graph showcase, I got very excited about exploring how nice I can make graphics in Stata: since this was an introductory data analysis class, focus here is on visuals *not* the models https://github.com/ivanadr/stata-graphs 
- ♻️ Cute signs that nudge and guide students to recycle, this was my lowkey activism as a student and I wanted to put the resources together so it can still be useful after I left the university https://github.com/ivanadr/nyuad-recycling-signs

 
#### Fun fact ⚡ 
- Creating micro-communities brings me joy (e.g. swim team captain, frisbee-after-work sessions)

#### Talk to me about
- Environmental impacts of food production (and how it is relevant to my research).
- All things related to gender studies, especially w.r.t. narratives on screen.
- Normativity in economics (any *.normativity as a matter of fact).
- How we organise  our work - anything from language, environment (both IDE and physical), folder hierarchy, naming conventions etc.
- My love for Python, how I integrated Stata with Jupyter lab with Stata's API, and what I did before I knew that was possible.
- Anything I had recently learned, although I will probably bring that up myself anyways (e.g. the week when I understood that the floating point system is behind why $\sum{\frac{x_i}{n}}$ is not $\frac{1}{n}\sum{x_i}$ in my data frame is the week that I could not stop talking about it).
