### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I'm Social Science Division Research Fellow at [New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD)](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/), where I also received my B.A. Economics with minors in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. My pronouns are she/they.

- My current research interests are in Environmental economics, Trade, Development
- My advisor is [Jordan Norris](https://www.jordanjnorris.com/)

#### Favourite learning moments ðŸ“– 
- Making Website for my student group [Women in STEM at NYUAD](https://ivanadr.github.io/westem-web-2022/)
- Math tutoring (Econometrics <-- Linar algebra <-- Statistics <-- Calculus)
- Making my Python code shorter, more readable and reusable
- Learning Git, Regex, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Selenium)
- Making the first interactive map (plotly express, GeoPandas) and first $\LaTeX$ document
- Integrating Stata with Python in Jupiter lab through Stata's API
- Understanding Floating point system and numerical representation of numbers in computer memory (which explains, e.g. why $\sum{\frac{x_i}{n}}$ may not equal $\frac{1}{n}\sum{x_i}$ when manipulating data series, while it is true in Math theory)
- My fist 'real life' data project that supported an asynchronous university swim competition during Covid, because it combined community building, project management and coding 

#### Fun facts âš¡ 
I enjoy swimming and reading plays
